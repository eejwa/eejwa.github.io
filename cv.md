# Employment

## Research Fellow (1st December 2021 – present)

- Quantitative research in geophysics involves working on a range of results-driven projects where working independently and collaborating with others is key.  

- Analyse large (terabytes+) seismic datasets with Python where I often automate workflows using clustering, traditional classification algorithms and neural networks. 

- Often use deep learning in projects such as locating earthquakes automatically from time series of ground motion, clustering to automatically identify seismic arrivals and random forests to sort seismograms. 

- Experienced in presenting complex analyses to non-experts verbally through presentations at international conferences, invited seminar presentations and research group meetings. 

- Practiced in communication through written work in terms of scientific manuscripts published in high-impact journals, blogs and annual progress reports. 

- Line management experience through supervising dissertation projects often based on my theoretical expertise, analytical algorithm knowledge and Python experience. 

- Practiced in producing clear and open-source code through experiences in collaborating on Python package terratools amongst others. 

- Proactive when seeking impactful responsibilities such as by driving the implementation of new deadlines throughout the PhD, organizing several conferences and leading the regular meetings of colleagues. 

### Mentoring experience

#### Project Leader – Turing Data Hackathon: (13 March - 24 March 2023).  

- Title: Detecting and Locating Earthquakes using Machine Learning.  
- Directed a group of software engineers, research fellows and data scientists and advised on machine learning approaches and seismological theory/application. 
 
#### Co-supervised undergraduate research project: (1 October 2022 – 28 April 2023).

- Title: Using Directivity Information to Analyse Lower Mantle Scatterers.
- Was the point of contact for technical and theoretical issues as well as thesis draft revisions.  

#### Summer research project: (6 June – 18 July 2022).  
-	Proposed the project idea and met regularly to aid with issues with Python, Bash and GitHub.  

#### Co-supervised undergraduate research project: (1 October 2018 – 28 April 2019).

- Title: Marking the boundaries of ancient crust in the mantle with observations of diffraction and multipathing.
- Was the point of contact for Matlab coding problems, theoretical explanation and report writing.   

### Responsibilities

#### Faculty of Environment Early Career Representative (6 February 2023 – Present) 

- Sit on the research IT committee to report and reinforce the needs of ECRs for research IT. 
- Attend the Faculty Research and Innovation Committee to discuss changes in contracts for ECRs and report on the design of data gathering on opinions of ECRs. 

## Self-taught training in machine learning (September 2021 - December 2021).

- Finished working through a textbook about the machine and deep learning in Python. 

- Worked on a number of projects including: 
    - Automatically identifying volcanoes on Venus 
    - Predicting ozone levels at recording stations in China
    - Sentiment analysis of tweets all using neural networks. 

## NERC Science and Policy Internship (19th January – 20th April 2019).

- Used natural language processing to analyse the questions asked by policy fellows over the past 10 years, which formed part of the annual review and 10-year anniversary.
- Created reports, case studies and media articles on roundtable discussions, interviews and private events on topics from transnational organised crime to climate change.

# Education

### University of Leeds (2nd October 2017 – 31st October 2021).
- PhD in Geophysics 
- Thesis Title: Analysis of Mantle Heterogeneity through Array Observations of Multipathing and its Expansion to a Global Scale
- Summary: My PhD aimed to use and develop signal processing techniques to make new observations of the Earth’s interior using Python. The methods have been improved to automate seismic wave identification and quantify their speed and directions with uncertainties through bootstrap sampling and unsupervised learning. I use Python for much of my work but also have experience using bash and editing Fortran and C++ codes. Throughout my PhD, I used HPC for numerical modelling and data processing.

#### Awards:
-	Runner up: Keith Runcorn Thesis Prize for Geophysics (2022).

### Imperial College London (28th September 2013 – 30th June 2017).
  - MSci Geophysics - First Class
